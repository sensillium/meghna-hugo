In the wee hours of Tuesday night, I sat the proctored Terraform associate exam.

After 3 years of practical experience (from v0.11 onwards) and 22.5 hours of udemy.com Terraform exam prep video content, I was feeling tired. It was 22:00 and I was staring at a bright monitor in a dimly lit room hoping nobody was going to shout through the speakers or start playing thrash metal hold music while I waited for the proctor to start the exam.

Then they pressed Go and I was off. 23 minutes later I clicked through the post-exam questionnaire and sat back to await the result.

I'm fairly sure I gave the game away with the post image, but I passed, with a score of 89.17%.

Woo!
