CI/CD tools, how can I compare thee?

The bard had a quill and a penchant for letting the underprivileged have some fun, and he single-handedly produced some of the greatest time fillers ever to grace the pages of books you were forced to read in school.

We in comparison are spoilt beyond compare with the plethora of tools at our disposal for turning indecipherable text into fantastic beasts; [Azure DevOps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/services/devops/), [Jenkins](https://jenkins.io/), [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/), [Gradle](https://gradle.org/), [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/), TFS, [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/), [TravisCI](https://travis-ci.org/), [TeamCity](https://www.jetbrains.com/teamcity/)...

How does one pick from the masses? There are even arguments for using more than one, why put all of the eggs in one basket? Fewer baskets equal fewer holes for insidious miscreants to poke, but more tools give you more ways to skin a feline, and some may be better at one particular metaphor than another.

Personally, as is my wont, I have the greatest experience with Azure DevOps or Visual Studio Online as it was called when I started using it, before being renamed Visual Studio Team Services before being renamed Azure DevOps. Both in terms of devising a branching strategy based on a process (Agile, Scrum, etc) and teams, or from managing the commits and pulls of code fragments or pushing releases to various Azure and AWS PaaS.

So in conclusion, there isn’t one. I posed a question and I’ll let you, the reader, answer it, this is really just a chance to paraphrase Shaky and a couple of others (did you spot them?) in a tech blog post.

Fin
